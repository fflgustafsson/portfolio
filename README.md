# portfolio

My own portfolio-theme. 

Based on what I think is needed to show and how to show in your portfolio as a developer, designer and photographer.

	- Startpage
	- Projects-page and project-articles
	- About you
	- Resume

The only add-on you need is ACF.

BUT. Use node_modules and gulp for most effective work.
